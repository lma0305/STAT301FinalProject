## Predicting Housing Price in Beijing
Housing is a universal need for all humans, positioned in the foundational level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. 
Yet, the surge in housing prices in recent decades has made its affordability increasingly challenging for many individuals and families. 
Notably, China experienced a great boom in the housing market in the last decade between 2007 and 2017. 
Studies conducted by the American Economics Journal showed that across 35 major Chinese cities, “the average real housing prices [grew] at an annual rate of 17 percent over the past decade, much higher than the average income growth rate of 11 percent”. 
The rise in prices is shaped by many sources including buyer demand, economic factors, and even policy decisions. 
An article by Emerald Publishing cited how in China, policymakers “must consider the potential impact of societal policies, such as the two-child policy, on housing prices”. 
For example, the two-child policy may impact demand for specific housing units with more bedrooms. 
Given the breadth of factors that impact housing prices, our group chose to evaluate various factors that influenced total housing prices in Beijing, China for our project. 
We aim to use our analysis as a case study to understand factors influencing prices during China’s market boom, which may be transferable to rising housing prices in other global markets today.
